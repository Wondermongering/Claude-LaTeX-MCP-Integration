In your LaTeX editor, highlight text describing an equation and use the context menu:

```
I need an equation for the normal distribution probability density function
```

Claude will generate:

```latex
\begin{equation}
f(x | \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\end{equation}
```

Ask Claude to help structure your document:

```
Help me organize a research paper on quantum computing algorithms
```

Claude will generate a document structure with appropriate sections.
